Interactive Quiz Application

2. Introduction (AG)
The Interactive Quiz Application is a web project whose goal is to quiz and enhance users' knowledge through presenting multiple-choice quizzes in various topics.  The project aims to offer a fun and educational experience through the use of minimalist web design techniques and JavaScript interactivity.  The aim of the project is to employ front-end web development in the form of HTML structure, CSS style, and JavaScript functionality.  The app will challenge users with timed quizzes, provide immediate feedback for responses, and show a final score at session end.  By developing this project, the team will demonstrate core learning outcomes from the course such as responsive web design, DOM manipulation, event handling, and local data storage using JavaScript.
